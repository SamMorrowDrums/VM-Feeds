VM-Feeds
========

Dynamic, interactive content aggregator for ViewMachine


VM-Feeds is designed to facilitate the aggregation, and display of aggregated ViewMachine data.

Rather than passing data feeds around the internet, VM enables you to pass interactive content around, and enables the recipient to choose how much processing they do (if any at all), so you can even share content with events, styling and more.

No Eval, just JSON.
